# SparseRegression

This package relies on primitives defined in the JuliaML ecosystem to implement high-performance algorithms for linear models which often produce sparsity in the coefficients.

# Installation

Note: SparseRegression requires Julia 0.6

```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/JuliaML/PenaltyFunctions.jl")
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/joshday/SparseRegression.jl")
Pkg.checkout("LossFunctions")
```

# This package is very much a work in progress
